 Linux File read and write – Day 06

Practiced basic file read/write using core Linux commands.  
Kept it simple and repeatable.


What I did


touch notes.txt
echo " how are you" > notes.txt
echo " where are you" >> notes.txt
echo " iam fine" | tee -a notes.txt
cat notes.txt
head -n 2 notes.txt
tail -n 2 notes.txt
