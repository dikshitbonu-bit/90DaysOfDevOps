 Linux File read and write – Day 06

Practiced basic file read/write using core Linux commands.  
Kept it simple and repeatable.


What I did


 1) touch notes.txt

2) echo " how are you" > notes.txt

3) echo " where are you" >> notes.

4) echo " iam fine" | tee -a notes.txt

5) cat notes.

6) head -n 2 notes.

7) tail -n 2 notes.txt
