90-Day Personal DevOps & Cloud Learning Plan
1. About myself and where i stand at

I come from a non-IT background. I do not assume prior experience with Linux, cloud, or programming. I am starting from fundamentals and building skills step-by-step with discipline and hands-on practice.

2. My Understanding of DevOps & Cloud Engineering

I gained an understanding that devops is not about high-end fancy named tools
but its an ongoing and ever-evolving culture of bridging the gap between the development and operations thereby reducing the time to market through automation and collaboration.

while on the other hand Cloud Engineering focuses on designing, deploying, and managing scalable infrastructure using cloud platforms like AWS or GCP or AZURE.

Together, DevOps + Cloud enable faster releases, reliability, automation, and scalability.

3. Why I Am Learning DevOps & Cloud

High demand skillset with strong career growth

Focuses more on systems, automation, and problem-solving than pure coding Which for an non-it person like me is like a goldmine.

Enables remote/global job opportunities, i love work from home man.

Clear learning path where effort compounds over time

I also heard the pay is good so yeah MONEY is also one factor.

4. Where I Want to Reach (After 90 Days)

I want to reach a junior DevOps-ready level, where I can confidently work with Linux, cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and containerized applications, and continue learning with clarity instead of confusion.Having said that i dont want to place limitations on myself and therefore i would do everything in my capacity to upskill myself so that i can be in a position to crack even 3-5yrs exp devops roles. 

5. My 3 Clear 90-Day Goals

Deploy a containerized application on AWS using Docker and Kubernetes (basic level)

Build a working CI/CD pipeline (Git → Build → Test → Deploy)

Manage and troubleshoot Linux servers confidently (processes, logs, networking basics)

6. Core DevOps Skills I Will Build

Linux & System Fundamentals

File systems, permissions, processes, networking, logs

CI/CD & Automation

Git, shell scripting basics, Jenkins/GitHub Actions

Containers & Cloud Basics

Docker, Kubernetes fundamentals, AWS EC2, IAM, basic networking

7. 90-Day Learning Breakdown

Days 1–30: Foundations

Linux basics (daily terminal usage)

Git & GitHub

Networking & OS basics

Shell scripting (very basic)

Days 31–60: DevOps Core

Docker (images, containers, volumes)

CI/CD pipelines

Jenkins or GitHub Actions

AWS basics (EC2, IAM, security groups)

Days 61–90: Real-World Practice

Kubernetes fundamentals

Deploy app using Docker + K8s

Monitoring basics

Troubleshooting & revision

Mini end-to-end project

8. Time Commitment & Consistency Plan

4 hours every day (7 days/week)

2 hours learning

2 hours hands-on practice

No zero days — even 30 minutes counts

Focus on completion over perfection

Weekly revision every Sunday

9. How I Will Stay Consistent
 By actively engaging with community for motivation and doubt clearance

Remind myself: slow progress is still progress and a MAN WHO NEVER GIVES UP CAN NEVER BE DEFEATED.
